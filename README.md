## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Open the repository Jupyter Notebook
* Open Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
* In the Files tab you should see folders that match the folders on your machine (i.e. Desktop, Documents, Downloads). Navigate to your repository folder by clicking on the folder links. Open the .ipynb file in your repository by clicking on it.

  * Enter the code and run it in your Jupyter Notebook file.
  * When you're done make sure you save your file.
  * The presenter provides the data file in a link below his video. Here's the link: https://www.csdojo.io/data
  * I also included the data files in this repository.

## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
